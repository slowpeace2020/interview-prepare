We are Ribbon
At Ribbon, our culture defines us. Our relentless focus on the customer, coupled with our entrepreneurial spirit, has solidified our position as one of the market-leading solutions leaders in the global telecommunications industry. Our culture’s foundation is based on our core values of innovation, imagination, execution and ethical responsibility. These shared values provide the platform for our employees, allowing them to share a global connection while simultaneously celebrating our diversity.

Respect - We are inclusive of ideas and people. We show regard for one another, our customers, our partners, and our communities.
Excellence - We do what it takes to get the job done right, in our solutions, our operations, and our customer service, internally and externally.
Accountability - We live up to our commitments and hold each other responsible. How we work together impacts what we do and how we are perceived.

We Are Ribbon - We operate as responsible corporate and global citizens. We are ethical in our dealings and inclusive in our approach. We believe that everyone: colleagues, partners, suppliers and customers, should be treated fairly; with respect and dignity. We value our brand as it represents our people, our products and the communities in which we live and work.

We continuously reward contributions and engage employees in fun and meaningful ways because we adamantly believe in celebrating our people and their achievements.

Together we can make a difference.

We recognize that in order to build long-term value for our markets, customers and employees, we must consider the way our company operates in the social, cultural, economic and environmental domains. Along the entire spectrum of our work, from R&D to building and supporting networks, and the applications that run on those networks, we are mindful of the impact our approaches have and are pleased by the opportunity to contribute to a better world through more open and available collaborative communications experiences.

We are known for our expertise in transforming networks, security and supporting the largest communications networks, delivering world-class solutions to service provides, enterprises and governments around the world. Ribbon is in a unique position to make a long-term and sustained difference for our societies and planet. Our “triple bottom line” focus recognizes that our business success is deeply connected to the world we serve. While some businesses chase economic gain, often at the expense of others, we recognize that a failure to account for social and environmental impacts would make such business practices unsustainable. We therefore operate with a great awareness and commitment to doing things the “right way” – and we have been rewarded for many years as we are able to attract talented, like-minded professionals to our team, and engage with our customers and our communities in quality relationships.
